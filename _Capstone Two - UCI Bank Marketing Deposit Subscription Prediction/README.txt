This project is based off a white paper titled: A data-driven approach to predict the success of bank tele-marketing. This paper shared a portion of the data from the study on UCI’s data repository for which I used to conduct my project. The goal of this project is to predict whether the Portuguese banking institution’s clients from the study would subscribe to long-term deposits via a telemarketing campaign. 

The data available was related to the customer demographic, previous telemarketing campaigns, other, and social and economic indicator data. The dataset presented imbalanced classes with 11.27% of the samples subscribing to the term deposit. Given that the Portuguese bank in the study was under government pressure to increase its capital requirements, the primary consideration of the bank was maximizing its sales of term deposits. It was less concerned with disturbing clients and the costs associated with running telemarketing campaigns. For this reason, I elected to assess the success of the model predictions using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve which best represents the mission of maximizing sales. Had the bank been concerned with not disturbing clientele or reducing marketing costs, I would have placed higher consideration on the precision recall curve. 

I tested five types of models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier, K-nearest Neighbors, and a Support Vector Classifier. I also tested three different datasets which included the raw data, rebalanced data using upsampling and a data frame with re-binned features. The best model was a Random Forest Classifier fit on the raw data. The optimal parameters were 360 estimators, a minimum sample leaf of 4, auto max features and a max depth of 15. This models area under the ROC curve and test accuracy were 0.7906 and 90.14% respectively . The non-upsampled dataset outperformed the upsampled dataset which can be explained by the fact that decision trees are robust against imbalanced datasets. 

Three of the five most important features of the dataset were all economic indicators which suggested that the current economic climate plays a more significant role in predicting telemarketing campaign success that customer-specific data. Aside from these, the most important customer-specific features were the number of days that passed since the client was last contacted from the previous campaign, age, and the number of contacts performed before this campaign.
