Analytics Vidya Black Friday Sales Forecasting 

This project walks through the data science process on the Black Friday sales forecasting problem hosted by Analytics Vidya and the problem specifics can be accessed here:  https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/black-friday/ 

This was my first capstone project for the Spring Board Data Science program so it walks through all steps of the data science process including data cleaning / ETL, exploratory data analysis, inferential statistical analysis, feature engineering, data visualization and storytelling, experiment design, modeling and model tuning, and communication of findings. 
â€¨The project is currently 80% completed, but showcases my current progress in learning data science skills.
