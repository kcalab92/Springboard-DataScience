The goal of this project was to predict ABC Private Limited (an online retailer) customer's purchase amounts for the upcoming month for a selection of popular products that the customers have purchased in the past. The data available for building the prediction model included the customersâ€™ purchasing history i.e. the product ID, purchase amount of the product (target variable) and product category (each product could fall into up to three different product categories) as well as customer demographic data including gender, age, occupation, city category, number of years stayed in current city, and marital status. 

The performance of the model was measured using the root mean square error (RMSE). The best model I was able to produce was a gradient boosting regressor which yielded a train RMSE of 2153.18, a test RMSE of 2422.90 and a leaderboard RMSE of 2463.14 and placed 114th out of over 900 submissions. Other algorithms I tried included a multi-linear regressor, a random forest regressor, and a multi-level perceptron regressor. I engineered a number of features, but the most important feature by a significant margin was the average purchase amount by product ID. Adding this feature alone dropped the RMSE from above 4,000 to under 2,500 depending on the model. Other significant engineered features, all in the top five most important features, included: average purchase amount by user, proportion of user purchases above the average product purchase amount, number of purchases per user, and number of purchase per product. Of the non-engineered features, the most significant indicator of purchase amount was product category. Of the customer demographic data, the most important factor in predicting purchase amount was occupation, age, and years stayed in current city. 

The most useful recommendation to ABC Private Limited management team would be the sales forecast numbers themselves which will allow them to optimize product supply chain and promotional activity. Aside from the sales forecasts, it would be my recommendation to management to focus advertising by targeting demographics based on occupation, age and the number of years they have lived in their current city. The associated report provides an in-depth written and visual analysis or the data as well as the methodology used in each step of the analysis process.
